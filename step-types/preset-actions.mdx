import { PresetActionBadgeInteractive, PresetActionBadgeBrowser } from "/snippets/preset-action-badge.mdx";

**Preset actions** are isolated steps that perform a single action on the current page and succeed immediately when that action is complete. They are the most granular steps available on Momentic, and serve as the building blocks for [AI actions](/docs/step-types/ai-actions).

In general, preset actions can be divided into two categories:

1. **Interactive**: Actions that interact with elements on the page, such as clicking on an element, selecting from a dropdown, or typing some content into an element.
2. **Browser**: Actions that affect the browser itself, such as hitting the back button, switching tabs, or refreshing the page.

## Preset action types

The following table lists the available preset action types:

| Name            | Type                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Options                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `Click`         | <PresetActionBadgeInteractive /> | Locate an element on the page matching a descriptor, and then click on it.<br/><br/>The element must be actionable for the click to succeed: it cannot be hidden, disabled, or animating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | `Double click`: double click on the element.<br/><br/> `Right click`: Right click on the element.                                                                                       |
| `Press keys`    | <PresetActionBadgeInteractive /> | Press a sequence of keys on the page.<br/><br/>Multiple keys can be pressed simultaneously by concatenating them with `+` (e.g. `CTRL+A`). Key presses may be used to invoke browser shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | None                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `Type`          | <PresetActionBadgeInteractive /> | Execute a `Click` command followed by a `Press` command. The element targeted should be an [input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | `Press enter`: press the enter key after typing completes (can be used to submit forms easily).<br/><br/> `Clear existing`: clear any existing content in the text input before typing. |
| `Select option` | <PresetActionBadgeInteractive /> | Select an option from a dropdown menu. The element targeted should be a [select](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | None                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `Wait`          | <PresetActionBadgeBrowser />     | Wait for the specified number of seconds.<br/><br/>This step type should be used rarely since other actions already automatically wait for network requests to complete, up to a maximum of `8` seconds.<br/><br/>If you need to wait for a particularly long request to complete, or if you expect the DOM to change after a large initial delay, you can use the `Wait` action to ensure Momentic actions on the correct state of the page. | None                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Best practices

### Using the locator button

<Frame caption="The locator button is available on commands that target a specific element (`Click`, `Type`, `Select`)">![Locator Button](/images/locator-button.png)</Frame>

The eye-shaped locator button allows users to preview what element would be targeted by an interactive step. When pressed, Momentic's AI web agent uses the user-provided descriptor to find a matching element on the page, and then highlights that element. If no element matches, an error message is displayed on the step card.

This feature can be used to "dry-run" actions and ensure that the correct element will be targeted during a test run. If Momentic highlights the wrong element, you can adjust your element descriptor without having to re-run all steps (view our guidelines for writing accurate descriptors [here](#best-practices)).

Additionally, for `Select` actions, the locator button populates the available dropdown values in the test editor. Using the locator button is highly recommended for `Select` steps to avoid the possibility of misspelling the desired dropdown value.

### Writing element descriptors

The first input field on interactive commands is always an _element descriptor_. This descriptor is passed to Momentic's AI web agent to locate a specific element during test runs. We recommend following the guidelines below to craft descriptors that are easily understandable by our web agent:

<Steps>

<Step title="Be specific about element type">

Describe the desired element with a specific [web
accessibility
role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles),
such as "the submit **button**", "the homepage **link**", or "password **input**". If you are unsure what type
of element you are targeting, you can use the [Chrome Dev
Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/full-accessibility-tree#full_accessibility_tree_in_devtools)
to find out.

</Step>

<Step title="Include labels">

If the desired element has a label, include that in your descriptor, such as "the **search** button" or "the **username** textbox". Our AI web agent will generally attempt to match this label to the "name", "id", or "[aria-label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label)" attribute of HTML elements on your website. Defining ARIA attributes not only improves the performance of Momentic tests, but also helps your website stay compliant with [ADA standards](https://www.access-board.gov/ada/).

</Step>

<Step title="Include positioning cues">

Our AI web agent understands basic relative positioning, and so you can provide cues such as "...**below** the 'Introduction' header" or "...**beside** the 'Back' button". Only use positioning cues if they are expected to be stable over time.

</Step>

<Step title="Avoid anti-patterns">

The following is currently unsupported by our AI agent:

- Targeting an element using its appearance (e.g. color or size).
- Targeting an element that is `hidden` by CSS or blocked by another element.
- Targeting static elements, such as raw text (`<h1>`) or images (`<img>`). If a static element appears to be interactive on your website, it is likely because there is a hidden link (`<a>`) above or around your element and you should target that link instead. You can still write [assertions](/docs/step-types/ai-checks) about static elements.

</Step>
