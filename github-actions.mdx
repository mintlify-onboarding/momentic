description: How to integrate Momentic with GitHub Actions.

You can use the [Momentic CLI](/cli) to easily integrate Momentic tests into your GitHub Actions steps and jobs.

## Usage

This is an example of how to setup Momentic tests to run on every pull request and commit to `main` using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Make sure to set the `MOMENTIC_API_KEY` secret in your [repository settings](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

The YAML below assumes that the command `npm run start` will start your application on `localhost:3000`. Customize these values to suit your build process.

```yaml
name: Test

env:
  MOMENTIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MOMENTIC_API_KEY }}

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  run-tests:
    name: Run tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: npm install

        # make sure to install browsers first before running tests locally (not required for remote tests)
      - run: npx momentic@latest install-browsers

        # run tests locally
      - run: npx momentic@latest run --local --start "npm run start" --wait-on http://localhost:3000 --tests c2c2fee4-4778-4bbb-8f0c-31f25f774726

        # run tests remotely
      - run: npx momentic@latest run --remote --tests c2c2fee4-4778-4bbb-8f0c-31f25f774726
```
